            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p class="para-2">I love to cook, but I haven’t always. In fact, for most of my early adult life, cooking
                dinner
                usually
                meant microwaving a frozen dinner or adding boiling water to something that came from a box. It wasn’t
                until I got married that I started eating real food because I married a girl who cooks. I started
                joining him in the kitchen and realized that cooking could be fun. Eating real food was really fun. And
                gaining confidence as a home chef? That was life changing!</p>

            <h3>Italian Salad</h3>
            <p class="justify">Here’s a great salad that’s simply perfection, in our books. This Italian salad is full
                of
                all the right
                flavors and textures: crisp lettuce, crunchy garlic croutons, and zingy pepperoncini. It’s covered in
                punchy, herby Italian vinaigrette that makes the flavors sing! It can play sidekick to just about
                anything</p>

            <h3>Macoroni</h3>
            <p class="justify">This baked mac and cheese is a family favorite recipe, loved by both children and
                adults. It uses a
                combination of cheeses, layered in the dish as well as melted into a rich and creamy cheese sauce, for
                the ultimate in cheesy deliciousness! Perfect for a comforting dinner or as a holiday side dish!</p>

            <h3>Green Salad</h3>
            <p class="justify">Place water in the bottom half of a steamer pan set. Add salt and butter, and bring to a
                boil. Trim the dry ends off of the asparagus. If the spears are thick, peel them lightly with a
                vegetable peeler. Place them in the top half of the steamer pan set. Steam for 5 to 10 minutes depending
                on the thickness of the asparagus, or until asparagus is tender.</p>
