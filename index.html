            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p class="para-2">I love to cook, but I haven’t always. In fact, for most of my early adult life, cooking
                dinner
                usually
                meant microwaving a frozen dinner or adding boiling water to something that came from a box. It wasn’t
                until I got married that I started eating real food because I married a girl who cooks. I started
                joining him in the kitchen and realized that cooking could be fun. Eating real food was really fun. And
                gaining confidence as a home chef? That was life changing!</p>
